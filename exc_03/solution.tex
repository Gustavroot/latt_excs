\section{a)}

An implementation of the code can be found in main.py and simulation.py.


\section{b), c), d), e)}

An example run of the correlator $C_{p}(\hat{\tau})$ can be found in corrs.png, as well as theh corresponding energy extraction, which can be found in eff\_energies.png. The energy has been extracted with the exponential for of the correlator.. hence, this calculation must be repeated but using the 3pt form of the correlator (to account for backward propagating waves).

After the energy computation has been fixed, then a lot of run with a large number of MC steps can be performed, and then a comparison against the continuum dispersion relation must be made.
