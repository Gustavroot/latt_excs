\maketitle

The code for all parts is implemenented in simulation.py, and tests are run through main.py.

Note that, values for the gauge links can be set through the method sim.set\_gauge\_links(TYPE), where TYPE takes the values "ones" or "random".

When acting through gauge transformations on the gauge links, the action (due to its dependance on the plaquettes) does not change indeed.
